QtDesigner Plugins
If you want to edit a VCP or create one from a template you need to have the QtDesigner plugins installed.
To load, you must have the correct version of libpyqt5.so in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/designer/. 
Precompiled libraries suitable for 64Bit Debian Stretch (or other system with Qt v5.11.3 and Py v3.9)
are included in the QtDesigner directory. The easiest way to install the libs to the correct location is to use the install.sh 
script located in the qtpyvcp/pyqt5designer/Qt5.11.3-64bit directory with this command.

sudo ./install.sh

If you are using a different architecture or Qt version you may need to compile PyQt5 from source to get the proper libpyqt5.so file. 
The steps should be similar those listed here.


1.1. Get Designer to include linuxcnc widgets
You must have designer installed; These commands should add it:
Or use your package manager to install the same:
sudo apt-get install qttools5-dev-tools
sudo apt-get install qttools5.dev

Then you need the python-module loading library added.
Qtvcp uses QT5 with python2 - this combination is not normally available from
repositories. You can compile it your self or there are precompiled versions
available for common systems.
in lib/python/qtvcp/designer there are folders based on system architectures
and then QT version.
You must pick the cpu architecture folder then pick the series; 5.5, 5.7, or 5.9 of Qt.
currently Debian stretch uses 5.7, Mint 12 uses 5.5, Mint 19 uses 5.9
if in doubt check the version of QT5 on the system.

You must decompress the file and then copy that proper version of
libpyqt5_py2.so to this folder:
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/designer
(x86_64-linux-gnu might be called something slightly different
on different systems)

You will require super user privileges to copy the file to the folder.

then you must add a link to the qtvcp_plugin.py to the folder that designer will search.

In a RIP version of linuxcnc qtvcp_plugin.py will be in:
~/LINUXCNC_PROJECT_NAME/lib/python/qtvcp/plugins/qtvcp_plugin.py

installed version should be:
usr/lib/python2.7/qtvcp/plugins/qtvcp_plugin.py
or usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qtvcp/plugins/qtvcp_plugin.py

make a link file to the above file and move it to one of the places Designer searches:

Designer searches in these two place for links (pick one):
This can be:
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/designer/python
or
~/.designer/plugins/python
You may need to add the plugins/python folders

To start Designer:

for a RIP installed:
open a terminal, set the environment for linuxcnc with the command: . scripts/rip-environment
then load designer with : designer -qt=5

otherwise for an installed version, open a terminal and type designer -qt=5

If all goes right you will see the selectable linuxcnc widgets on the left hand side
